# What BOMO really solves #
### The 3 C’s of Healthcare: Cost, convenience, consistency.

### COST
Software to accurately track joint flexion, walking patterns, and body movement is extremely costly and hard to setup in a normal environment: e.g., a home, gym, or small doctor’s office.

### CONVENIENCE
In order to actually get accurate measurmenets, you likely have to go to a motion analysis lab and have the ability to access one in the first place.

### CONSISTENCY 
Physical therapists and doctors often don’t take enough care to consistently take accurate measurments and often “eyeball” their results.
